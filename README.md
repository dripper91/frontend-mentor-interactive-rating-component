## My process

This is a non-responsive/desktop solution for the interactive rating component challenge at Frontend Mentor. I learned most of my front end knowledge from the Free Code Camp "Front End Web Dev" tutorial by Zach Gollwitzer:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this challenge, I used a css class "hidden" in conjunction with event listeners to toggle elements to be hidden or not hidden.

### Continued development

In the future I hope to make more responsive web pages and continue to do cool stuff with JS.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys&t=59708s) - Amazing course from FreeCodeCamp. Zach is a great teacher and developer.
